# BiocPy: Facilitate Bioconductor Workflows in Python

**BiocPy brings [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org)'s core data structures and analysis tools to the Python ecosystem.** 
These structures, including [BiocFrame](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocFrame) and [GenomicRanges](https://github.com/BiocPy/GenomicRanges), 
serve as essential and foundational data structures, acting as the building 
blocks for extensive and complex representations. 
For example, container classes like 
[SummarizedExperiment](https://github.com/BiocPy/SummarizedExperiment), [SingleCellExperiment](https://github.com/BiocPy/SingleCellExperiment), 
and [MultiAssayExperiment](https://github.com/BiocPy/MultiAssayExperiment) represent single or multi-omic experimental data and metadata.

## Installation

All packages in the `BiocPy` are published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Install the core packages using the `biocpy` wrapper:

```sh
pip install biocpy
```

Individual packages can be installed separately. See each package's documentation for specific installation instructions.
